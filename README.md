Hey everyone, it's day 62 of my 100 Days of Code. I made this simple loading animation. In this project, I learned how to use SVG for text animation and play around with CSS keyframes to create a smooth loading effect. I didn't know about properties like stroke-width, stroke-dashoffset, stroke-dasharray... before starting, and now I have a full understanding of them. It's amazing how a few lines of code can bring words to life. [Check it out!](https://roobiwebdev.github.io/Day-62-SVG-Text-Loader/)
